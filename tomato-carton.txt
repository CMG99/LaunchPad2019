NEW DROPDOWN BOX Recycle

Blue Bag
(Cardboard, cartons, and brown paper category)

Please remove all plastic, sticky tape and polystyrene before putting out for recycling.
Please flatten, fold or cut your cardboard so that it’s no bigger than 45cm square.
If it fits into your blue bag it will fit into our vehicles.
Please keep cardboard separate from the paper – it is  recycled separately.
