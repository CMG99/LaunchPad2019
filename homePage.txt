NEW DROPDOWN BOX Recipe
1.9 million tonnes of food is wasted by the food industry
every year in the UK. 250,000 tonnes of the food that goes to
waste each year is still edible. Cooking with every last
little bit makes cooking more fun and creative—and
less expensive! On LazyRecycle, in association with charity
shops and food related websites, you can find many creative
ways of using your food remains to make delicious recipes.
